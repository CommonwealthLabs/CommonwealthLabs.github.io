      "description" : "We are a nation in the -,+ quadrant. The nation is made up of various boroughs each with its own culture and assets. Our national government is a constitutional monarchy, but it has a light touch on the day-to-day lives of ordinary citizens. The Commonwealth is one of, if not the most economically active places in the world with production in virtually every niche. We have multiple large towns and an active player base. Our discord is so popular that at times our #general channel has been mistaken for the entire server's place for chat."
